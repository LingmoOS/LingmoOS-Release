      org.mpris.MediaPlayer2:
      @short_description: Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification

      The Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification is a standard
      D-Bus interface which aims to provide a common programmatic API
      for controlling media players.
  -->
  <interface name="org.mpris.MediaPlayer2">

  <!--
      Raise:

      Brings the media player's user interface to the front using any
      appropriate mechanism available.

      The media player may be unable to control how its user interface
      is displayed, or it may not have a graphical user interface at
      all. In this case, the CanRaise property is false and this
      method does nothing.
  -->
    <method name="Raise"/>

  <!--
      Quit:

      Causes the media player to stop running.

      The media player may refuse to allow clients to shut it down. In
      this case, the CanQuit property is false and this method does
      nothing.

      Note: Media players which can be D-Bus activated, or for which
      there is no sensibly easy way to terminate a running instance
      (via the main interface or a notification area icon for example)
      should allow clients to use this method. Otherwise, it should
      not be needed.

      If the media player does not have a UI, this should be
      implemented.
  -->
    <method name="Quit"/>

  <!--
      CanQuit:

      If false, calling Quit will have no effect, and may raise a
      NotSupported error. If true, calling Quit will cause the media
      application to attempt to quit (although it may still be
      prevented from quitting by the user, for example).

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="CanQuit" type="b" access="read"/>

  <!--
      Fullscreen:

      Whether the media player is occupying the fullscreen.

      This is typically used for videos. A value of true indicates
      that the media player is taking up the full screen.

      Media centre software may well have this value fixed to true

      If CanSetFullscreen is true, clients may set this property to
      true to tell the media player to enter fullscreen mode, or to
      false to return to windowed mode.

      If CanSetFullscreen is false, then attempting to set this
      property should have no effect, and may raise an error. However,
      even if it is true, the media player may still be unable to
      fulfil the request, in which case attempting to set this
      property will have no effect (but should not raise an error).

      This property is optional. Clients should handle its absence
      gracefully.

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="Fullscreen" type="b" access="readwrite"/>

  <!--
      CanSetFullscreen:

      If false, attempting to set Fullscreen will have no effect, and
      may raise an error. If true, attempting to set Fullscreen will
      not raise an error, and (if it is different from the current
      value) will cause the media player to attempt to enter or exit
      fullscreen mode.

      Note that the media player may be unable to fulfil the
      request. In this case, the value will not change. If the media
      player knows in advance that it will not be able to fulfil the
      request, however, this property should be false.

      This property is optional. Clients should handle its absence
      gracefully.

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="CanSetFullscreen" type="b" access="read"/>

  <!--
      CanRaise:

      If false, calling Raise will have no effect, and may raise a
      NotSupported error. If true, calling Raise will cause the media
      application to attempt to bring its user interface to the front,
      although it may be prevented from doing so (by the window
      manager, for example).

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="CanRaise" type="b" access="read"/>

  <!--
      HasTrackList:

      Indicates whether the /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 object implements
      the org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.TrackList interface.

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="HasTrackList" type="b" access="read"/>

  <!--
      Identity:

      A friendly name to identify the media player to users.

      This should usually match the name found in .desktop files

      (eg: "VLC media player").

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="Identity" type="s" access="read"/>

  <!--
      DesktopEntry:

      The basename of an installed .desktop file which complies with
      the Desktop entry specification, with the ".desktop" extension
      stripped.

      Example: The desktop entry file is
      "/usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop", and this property
      contains "vlc"

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="DesktopEntry" type="s" access="read"/>

  <!--
      SupportedUriSchemes:

      The URI schemes supported by the media player.

      This can be viewed as protocols supported by the player in
      almost all cases. Almost every media player will include support
      for the "file" scheme. Other common schemes are "http" and
      "rtsp".

      Note that URI schemes should be lower-case.

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="SupportedUriSchemes" type="as" access="read"/>

  <!--
      SupportedMimeTypes:

      The mime-types supported by the media player.

      Mime-types should be in the standard format (eg: audio/mpeg or
      application/ogg).

      When this property changes, the
      org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged signal is
      emitted with the new value.
  -->
    <property name="SupportedMimeTypes" type="as" access="read"/>
